        <h3 id="overview">1. General Overview</h3>
        <pre>
> The Sun is the star at the center of our Solar System.
> It is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
> Diameter: ~1.4 million km, about 109 times the size of Earth.
> Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium.
        </pre>
        <h3 id="second">2. Orbit and Rotation</h3>
        <pre>
> The Sun does not orbit around another star; it is the center of the Solar System.
> It rotates on its axis, completing one rotation approximately every 25 to 35 days.
> The Sun’s rotation is not uniform; the equator rotates faster than the poles.
        </pre>
        <h3 id="third">3. Structure and Composition</h3>
        <pre>
> The Sun consists of several layers:
   - Core: Where nuclear fusion occurs.
   - Radiative Zone: Energy from fusion radiates outward.
   - Convective Zone: Hot plasma rises, cools, and falls.
   - Photosphere: The Sun's visible surface.
> The Sun is mainly composed of hydrogen (~75%) and helium (~24%).
> The remaining 1% is made up of heavier elements like oxygen, carbon, and iron.
        </pre>
        <h3 id="fourth">4. Temperature and Energy</h3>
        <pre>
> The Sun's core temperature is approximately 15 million °C (27 million °F).
> The surface temperature (photosphere) is around 5,500 °C (9,932 °F).
> The Sun produces energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium.
> This energy is what powers the Solar System and provides heat and light to Earth.
        </pre>
        <h3 id="fifth">5. Unique Facts</h3>
        <pre>
> The Sun makes up 99.86% of the mass of the entire Solar System.
> It has a strong magnetic field that causes solar flares and sunspots.
> Without the Sun, life on Earth would not exist as we know it.
> The Sun is approximately 4.6 billion years old and is expected to live for another 5 billion years.
