        <h3 id="overview">1. General Overview</h3>
        <pre>
> Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is famous for its stunning ring system.
> Named after the Roman god of agriculture and wealth.
> Diameter: ~120,536 km (9.5 times the size of Earth).
        </pre>
        <h3 id="second">2. Orbit and Rotation</h3>
        <pre>
> Saturn takes ~29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun.
> A day on Saturn lasts ~10.7 hours (one of the shortest days in the solar system).
> Axis tilt of 26.7° gives it seasonal changes.
        </pre>
        <h3 id="third">3. Surface and Composition</h3>
        <pre>
> Saturn is a gas giant with no solid surface; composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.
> Its interior likely has a core of rock and metal surrounded by metallic hydrogen.
> The planet is less dense than water—it would float if there were a body of water large enough.
        </pre>
        <h3 id="fourth">4. Atmosphere and Temperature</h3>
        <pre>
> Atmosphere is composed of hydrogen (~96%) and helium (~3%), with traces of methane and ammonia.
> Average temperature: ~-178°C (-288°F).
> Strong winds and large storms, including a hexagonal storm at its north pole.
        </pre>
        <h3 id="fifth">5. Unique Facts</h3>
        <pre>
> Saturn has the most extensive ring system in the solar system, made of ice, rock, and dust.
> It has 83 known moons, including Titan, the second-largest moon in the solar system.
> The Cassini spacecraft explored Saturn and its moons for over 13 years.
